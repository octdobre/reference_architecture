# :e-mail: Digital Certificates(X.509) and Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)

A digital certificate is a file that proves authenticity.

A PKI(Public-Key Infrastructure) is used to manage digital certificates.

For web usage, a digital certificate is also called a SSL/TLS certificate.
It is used to provide a HTTPS connection between the clients and the services.
When a HTTPS connection is established, trust has been guaranteed that the client and 
the server are authentic and data transfered between them is encrypted.

## 1. Creating self-signed certificates <a name="chap1"></a>

This section will describe how to create a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate.

It is called a 'self-signed' because the properties 'Issuer(Issued By)' and 'Subject(Issued To)' are the same.

Self-signed certificates are mostly used for development purposes to run a webserver on your localhost, 
or for ease of use, to host services on your home lab inside your private network.

To create one, first generate a RSA or ECDSA private key:
```
openssl genrsa -out selfsigned.pri

openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -noout -genkey -out selfsigned.pri
```

The follow details represent a minimal set for openssl configuration properties
to be able to create a self signed certificate:
```
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
default_md         = sha256
default_days       = 365
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions     = req_ext
x509_extensions    = v3_ca
prompt             = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
CN = localhost
O  = Self Generated Certificate 

[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ v3_ca ]
subjectAltName           = @alt_names
basicConstraints         = critical, CA:FALSE
keyUsage                 = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage         = critical, serverAuth
1.3.6.1.4.1.311.84.1.1   = DER:02

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1   = localhost
DNS.2   = 127.0.0.1
```

Create a file called `selfsigned.cnf` with the contents from above.

Generate the self-signed certificate with the following command:
```
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.pri -out selfsigned.cer -config selfsigned.cnf
```
At this point the certificate is ready to be used.

Examine the certificate:
```
openssl x509 -in sscert.cer -noout -text
```

Package the certificate into a pkcs12(.pfx) file:
```
openssl pkcs12 -export -in selfsigned.cer -inkey ca.pri -name "<inset friendly name here>" -out selfsigned.pfx
```

Examine the certificate in pkcs12 format:
```
openssl pkcs12 -info -in selfsigned.pfx
```

Other way to generate the RSA private key and certificate in one go:
```
openssl req -x509 -config selfsigned.cnf -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ca2.pri -out selfsigned2.cer
```

Properties that are configured in the configuration file can also be specified as flags:
```
// add custom subject properties

-subj '/CN=Test1/O=Acme Inc./OU=PKI'

-addext "basicConstraints=critical, CA:true, pathlen:1"

-addext "subjectAltName = DNS:acme-inc.com, IP:127.0.0.1"

-addext "keyUsage = critical,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment"

-addext "extendedKeyUsage = critical,codeSigning"

```

## 2. Creating a root CA and issue a user certificates <a name="chap2"></a>

A root CA certificate can be used to issue other certificates creating a trust chain.

The root certificate can be used to validate issued certificates.

A root certificate with a single level of certification is not very common and 
in most cases used on private networks.

Here is a simplified configuration for a single level root ca:
```
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
default_md         = sha256
default_days       = 365
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions    = v3_ca
prompt             = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
CN = RootCa1
O  = Root Ca 1 Level
OU = Root Ca 1 Security Department

[ v3_ca ]
# must identify as CA and pathlen:0 so issued certificates cannot issue more
basicConstraints         = critical,CA:TRUE, pathlen:0

# must be eligible for signing
keyUsage                 = critical, keyCertSign, cRLSign

subjectKeyIdentifier     = hash
```
Create a file called `rootca.cnf` with the contents from above.

Generate Root CA and private key:
```
openssl req -x509 -config rootca.cnf -nodes -keyout rootca.pri -out rootca.cer
```

Use this configuration to create a certificate signing request:
```
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
default_md         = sha256
default_days       = 365
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
x509_extensions    = v3_req
prompt             = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
CN = localhost
O  = Web Server Certificate
OU = Web Server Certificate Security Department

[ v3_req ]
# must not identify as CA
basicConstraints         = critical,CA:false

# must be eligible for digital signature
keyUsage                 = critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment, nonRepudiation

subjectKeyIdentifier     = hash

# must be created for server authentication
extendedKeyUsage         = serverAuth
subjectAltName           = @sans

[ sans ]
DNS.0 = localhost
DNS.1 = 127.0.0.1
```
Create a file called `request.cnf` with the contents from above.

Generate Certificate Request (CSR):
```
openssl req -new -config request.cnf -nodes -keyout webssl.pri -out request.csr
```

Sign Certificate Request (Sign CSR)(And the extensions also from the CSR)
```
openssl x509 -req -in request.csr -CA rootca.cer -CAkey rootca.pri -CAcreateserial -out webssl.cer -extensions v3_req -extfile request.cnf
```
The `webssl.cer` is now ready to be used by a servie to provice a HTTPS connection.

In this scenario the root certificate can be distributed without the private key to clients and the 
issued certificates can be distributed to server applications.
The root certificate will trust and validate the issued certificates.

## 3. In-depth about digital certificates <a name="chap3"></a>

`X.509` is the format of a Public Key Certificate (Digital certificate).

There are multiple versions of a Public Key Certificate and each version builds on top
of the previous one.

| Version | Included |
|---|---|
| V1 | Serial Number, Algorithm Identifier, Issuer, Subject, Validity, Public Key | 
| V2 | Unique Identifier for Issuer and Subject |
| V3 | Extensions |

A `X.509` certificate contains two important sections:
- TBSCertificate(To be signed certificate)
- Extensions

TBSCertificate is used to define the basic cryptographic properties of a certificate 
and is comprised of:
- Version of X.509 certificate(Latest is V3)
- Serial Number
- Signing and Hashing algorithm identifiers
- Subject and Issuer
- Validity date

Extensions are arbitrary properties that allow a certificate to be customized further
for specific properties. 

Some of the extensions include the definition of a CA, the path length of a certificate path, CRT(Certificate Revocation List) or OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol), Time stamping and much more. 

A Certificate Revocation List :
- a signed Database of Revoked Certificates
- it is always signed by the CA publishing it
- always timestamped

## 4. Why do we need a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) ?  <a name="chap4"></a>

A PKI or Public Key Infrastructure is used for issuing, storing and managing 
digital certificates. It is called "infrastructure" because it involdes both hardware
and software to achieve it's purpose. 

One example is OpenSSL, the open-source software is one piece of a PKI which can be used to issue and sign and revoke certificates. 

Only these capabilities are not enaugh to help a web server be secured. Other software would need to be involded 
to distribute certificates to clients and offer functionalities such as OCSP.

One of the most common architectures for a PKI is to use a multi level chain of CA certificates.

One root certificate authority is issued from which sub-root certificate authorities can also be issued.
Then the sub-root CAs can issue server or client certificates. 

This will make sure that if sub-root CAs get compromised, it can be replaced easily.

## 5. OpenSSL configuration important parts  <a name="chap5"></a>

In this chapter we describe the sections used in a openssl configuration file
to create a SSL certificate.

### Request section <a name="chap5sub1"></a>
Here we define the section used for a creation of a certificate.

This section is used by the `req` command.

```
[req]
# Size of cipher Key
default_bits            = 4096

# Hashing algorithm identifier
default_md              = sha256

# Encoding
utf8                    = yes
string_mask             = utf8only

# Subject field
distinguished_name      = ca_dn

# Extensions field used for the CSR
req_extensions          = ca_req_ext

# Extensions that will be included in the issued certificate
x509_extensions         = ca_x509_ext

prompt                  = no
```

The `ca_dn` section contains the Subject (and Issuer if it is a CA) information.

The `ca_req_ext`  V3 extensions of the certificate signing request.

The `ca_x509_ext` V3 extensions of the issued SSL certificate.

The `prompt` setting is used tell the command to not wait for any prompts.

### CA Distinguished Name <a name="chap5sub2"></a>

Here we define the Subject (and Issuer if it is a CA) of the certificate.

```
[ ca_dn ]
# Mandatory
CN           = Example Corp Root CA
C            = US
O            = Example Corp

# Optional
ST           = California
L            = Los Angeles
OU           = Example Corp Security
emailAddress = admin@example.com
```

Below is a table with explanations.
| Short form | Full Name |
|--  |--                 |
| CN | Common Name       |
| C  | Country           |
| O  | Organization      |
| ST | State             |
| L  | Location          |
| OU | Organization Unit |

`emailAddress` has no short form.

### CA Default  <a name="chap5sub3"></a>

Here we define default value for the `ca` command
such as paths to find existing cryptographic artifacts or place newly generated ones.

```
[ ca ]
default_ca = ca_dafault

[ ca_dafault ]
# Path where the CA files and directories are stored
dir               = /home/myuser/ca

# Directory where issued certificates are stored
certs             = $dir/certs
new_certs_dir     = $dir/newcerts

# File that maintains the CA's certificate database
database          = $dir/index.txt

# Serial number to be used for certificate signing
serial            = $dir/serial

# Random data for cryptographic operations
RANDFILE          = $dir/private/.rand

# Path to the private key file used by the CA
private_key       = $dir/private/myrootCA.key

# Specifies the path to the CA's own certificate file
certificate       = $dir/certs/myrootCA.crt

# Specifies the default validity period (in days) for certificates issued by the CA
default_days      = 3650

#CLR
# Directory where the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) files are stored
crl_dir           = $dir/crl

# Specifies the path to the file that maintains the current CRL number
crlnumber         = $dir/crlnum

# Specifies the path to the CRL file generated by the CA
crl               = $dir/crl/mycrl.pem

# Specifies the default validity period (in days) for the CRL
default_crl_days  = 30

# Specifies the policy section that defines the CA's policies
policy            = policy_match

unique_subject    = no
copy_extensions   = none
preserve          = no

prompt            = no
```

`unique_subject` determines whether the CA should enforce uniqueness of subject names for issued certificates. When set to no, as in this case, the CA does not enforce uniqueness. It means that multiple certificates can be issued with the same subject name.

`copy_extensions` determines whether the V3 extensions are copied from the CSR to the issued certificate.

`preserve` is used to control whether existing files should be preserved or overwritten when generating new certificates or other cryptographic artifacts.

### CA Policies  <a name="chap5sub4"></a>

This section is used to check if issued certificates respect
the configured option.

| Value     | Meaning                                                         |
| ---       | ---                                                             |
| supplied  | The field must be supplied                                      |
| match     | The filed must match the ones in the issuing certificate        |
| optional  | These fields are optional, and values do not need to be matched |


```
[policy_match]
commonName              = supplied

countryName             = match
organizationName        = match

stateOrProvinceName     = optional
organizationalUnitName  = optional
emailAddress            = optional
```

### V3 Extensions <a name="chap5sub5"></a>

Version 3 of the X.509 certificate format introduces extensions. These represent extra 
properties of a SSL certificate.

Here is an example of a root CA with 1 sub level of certificates.
This certificate can only issue sub-root certificates.
```
[ ca_x509_ext ]
subjectKeyIdentifier    = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid:always,issuer:always
basicConstraints        = critical,CA:TRUE,pathlen:1
keyUsage                = critical,keyCertSign,cRLSign
```

`subjectKeyIdentifier`: The Subject Key Identifier (SKI) extension identifies certificates that contain a particular public key. This is a hash value of the SSL certificate.

`authorityKeyIdentifier`: The Authority Key Identifier (AKI) extension provides information about the Issuing CA certificate. `keyid` specifies the key identifier of the public key of the Issuing CA and `issuer` specifies the 
DN of the Issuing CA.

`basicConstraints`: This extension indicates whether a certificate is a Certificate Authority (CA) or not.
It also specifies the path lenght constraint.

`keyUsage`: This property specifies The Key Usage extension, which indicates the purpose and permissions for the certificate's key pair. The value `critical` indicates that if software or system encounters a certificate with an unrecognized or unsupported key usage extension, it will reject or flag the certificate as invalid. `keyCertSign` can be used to sign certificates and `cRLSign` can sign certificate revocation lists (`cRLSign`). 

Here is an example of a sub-root CA with 0 sub level of certificates.
This certificate can issue only client and server certificates.
```
[sub_ca_x509_ext]
subjectKeyIdentifier    = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid:always,issuer:always
basicConstraints        = critical,CA:true,pathlen:0
keyUsage                = critical,keyCertSign,cRLSign

# Optional
authorityInfoAccess     = @issuer_info
crlDistributionPoints   = @crl_info
nameConstraints         = @name_constraints
extendedKeyUsage        = clientAuth,serverAuth
```

In this scenario in the `basicConstraints` extension, the `pathlen` property is reduced to 0 indicating that 
issued certificates can not issue other certificates on their own.

`authorityInfoAccess` is used to provide information about the Issuing CA and `crlDistributionPoints` is used
to define 

`nameConstraints` extension can be used to enforce various restrictions, such as limiting the certificate's usage to a specific set of domains or subdomains, defining restrictions on email addresses, or specifying IP address ranges that are allowed.

`extendedKeyUsage` extension uses object identifiers (OIDs) to identify the specific purposes or usages. `serverAuth` is used to establish HTTPS connections and `clientAuth` is used for client authentication. Other values are `codeSigning`, `emailProtection`, `timeStamping` and `ocspSigning`.

Here is an example for a client or server certificate.
This certificate cannot be ussed to issue and sign other certificates.
They are only used for digital signatures and non-repudiation.
```
[ client_server_x509_ext ]
subjectKeyIdentifier    = hash
basicConstraints        = critical,CA:false
authorityKeyIdentifier  = keyid:always,issuer:always
keyUsage                = critical,digitalSignature,keyEncipherment,nonRepudiation
extendedKeyUsage        = clientAuth,serverAuth
subjectAltName          = @sans

[ sans ]
DNS.0 = localhost
DNS.1 = example.com
DNS.2 = api.example.com
```

In this scenario the `basicConstraints` specifies that the certificate is not a CA. 
The `keyUsage` extension is specified for authentication and encryption, and the `extendedKeyUsage` is
specified as client or server authentication.

`subjectAltName`: The Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension allows additional identities to be bound to the subject of the certificate. The DNS name (dNSName) extension is used to add an additional fully qualified domain name to a SSL certificate.

## 6. Creating a two-tier PKI with CA and Intermediate CA <a name="chap6"></a>

In this section we will combine the knowledge and practice from the previous sections in order to:
- Create our own PKI
- Create a root CA and a sub-root CA
- Issue certificates ready for web and client auth

Breakdown of commands to be used:
- `openssl req` will be used to create the root CA certificate
- `openssl req` will be used to create a CSR for a sub-root CA
- `openssl ca` will be used to sign and issue the sub-root CA

Example configuration file to define a root CA:

### Generate root CA <a name="chap6sub1"></a>

Create folder structure:
```
mkdir  ca  subca  
```

Inside each of the `ca` and `subca` folders create the following folder structure:
```
mkdir data private crl csr issued_certs cert
```

1. Navigate to the `ca` folder and generate a file with random data:
```
openssl rand -hex -out private/.rand 16
```

2. Create a file to index all certificates issued by rootCA
```
touch data/index.dat
```
3. Create a serial number
```
openssl rand -hex -out data/serial.dat  8
```
4. Create crl_number file

```
echo "1000" > data/crl_number
```

5. Creat root configuration file from the contents above and name it `ca.cnf`. 

8. Generate root CA certificate and private key in one step:
```
openssl req -config ca.cnf -new -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout private/ca.key -extensions ca_x509_ext -out cert/ca.cer
```
You can use the flag `-nodes` to create an encrypted private key. It will promp for a password.

9. Examine the certificate
```
openssl x509 -in cert/ca.cer -noout -text
```

10. Navigate to the `subca` folder and repeat the steps 1-4.

11. Creat root configuration file from the contents above and name it `subca.cnf`. 

11. Navigate to the `ca` folder and generate subca certificate signing request:
```
openssl req -config ca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout csr/subca.key -out csr/subca.csr
```
12. Sign certificate request with root CA
```
openssl ca -config ca.cnf -notext -extensions sub_ca_x509_ext -in csr/subca.csr
```
13. Copy the `subca` certificate from the `issued_certs` in the `ca` folder and place it in the `subca/cert` folder.

### Issuing certificates <a name="chap6sub2"></a>

Here we will issue certificates to be used by web servers and clients.
The `subca` will issue these certificates.

To issue certificates we need to create CSRs (cerfificate signing requests) and then sign them with the `subca`.

#### Issue a server certificate <a name="chap6sub2sub1"></a>

Create CSR and key:
```
openssl req -config subca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout csr/webssl.key -out csr/webssl.csr
```
Sign:
```
openssl ca -config subca.cnf -notext -extensions server_x509_ext -in csr/webssl.csr
```
#### Issue a client certificate <a name="chap6sub2sub1"></a>
Create CSR and key:
```
openssl req -config subca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout csr/client.key -out csr/client.csr
```
Sign:
```
openssl ca -config subca.cnf -notext -extensions client_x509_ext -in csr/client.csr
```
#### Issue a code signing certificate <a name="chap6sub2sub1"></a>

```
openssl req -config subca.cnf -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout csr/codesigning.key -out csr/codesigning.csr
```

```
openssl ca -config subca.cnf -notext -extensions codeSigning_x509_ext -in csr/codesigning.csr
```

#### Create a CA Bundle <a name="chap6sub3"></a>

A CA bundle is a file containing all certificates in a Certification Path concatenated together
and is used only for old and obsolete systems. 

The certificates need to be in PEM format and would need to be concatenaded in reverse order:
```
Subca 3
Subca 2
Subca 1
Root
```

A example:
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
0HHpnhd /*....*/
dsnaod0HHpnhd==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
tgO /*....*/
JkbtgOnhb==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Ntb /*....*/
LoNtboO==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Any text editor can be used to create this file.

Verify that the CA bundle is ok
```
openssl verify -CAfile cert/cacerts.cer subca.cer
```
