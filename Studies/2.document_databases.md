# :page_facing_up: Document Databases: Storage Technology Flavor

## 1. Introduction

A document database stores data in document format, often using JSON or BSON, 
as opposed to traditional SQL databases. This approach is commonly referred to as NoSQL. 
This article explores the advantages of document databases and compares various implementations.

## 2. Databases under discussion

The databases being discussed here are only self-hostable. However, some companies also offer a cloud version.

### MongoDb

Future databases to consider:
### CouchDb
### RavenDB
### Cassandra
### Neo4j
### PostgreSQL with JSONB
### SQL Server wiht JSON column

## 3. CRUD Operations

### Considerations

This chapter explores the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities of document databases.

### MongoDb

A document is stored in a collection, and collections are stored in a database. MongoDB provides a user-friendly client driver for performing CRUD operations on documents. Collections have no schema, allowing multiple types of documents to be stored together. It is recommended to group similar documents in a collection. MongoDB also offers a convenient feature where databases and collections are created automatically when saving documents, saving time compared to SQL databases where an SQL script is required for creating both the database and tables.


## 4. Indexes, Composed Keys

### Considerations

This chapter explores indexes and composed keys in document databases.

### MongoDb

MongoDB creates a unique "_id" property by default for every document, saved as binary data. If the document already has an ID property when being saved, it will overwrite the value generated by MongoDB. The client driver can be configured to display the ID as a GUID value when exploring the database with MongoDB Compass GUI application. Furthermore, additional indexes can be created on other properties, including composed keys of multiple properties.

## 5. Filtering, Sorting, Pagination

### Considerations

This chapter explores the capabilities of filtering, sorting, and pagination in document databases.

### MongoDb

The client drivers offer filtering, sorting, and pagination functionality when retrieving documents. The filter function in the client driver follows the specification pattern, where a filter must be created as a separate object and passed to the function. The client also offers a fluent API, similar to LINQ, for performing these operations in a chained fashion.

## 6. Schema(less), Constraints, Projections, Views

### Considerations

This chapter explores the schemaless nature of documents, absence of constraints, and the capabilities to project and create views in document databases.

### MongoDb

Documents in MongoDB are schemaless, allowing fields to be added or removed without affecting others in the collection. While this may create some uncertainty as documents do not have a fixed structure, it can also be advantageous as it allows the application to determine which fields the documents should have.

Properties of documents in MongoDB do not have constraints, allowing them to be added, modified, or removed without any restrictions.

MongoDB allows for the creation of views, which can be derived from one or multiple documents in the database.

## 7. Partial Updates, Partitioning, Concurrency, Transactions

### Considerations

This chapter explores the ability to partially update a document, partitioning, and the concurrency aspect of document databases.

### MongoDb

MongoDB client drivers support partial updates on document properties. These operations are atomic and can be executed concurrently. 

MongoDB provides horizontal scaling through sharding, where data is partitioned into chunks and distributed across multiple machines. A shard collection must be created with the shard key, and the database engine handles the chunks.

By default, the mongo client does not use the unit of work pattern when interacting with documents. Actions are atomic only on documents, and databases and collections can be accessed concurrently. However, using partial update features, documents can be updated atomically at the property level, minimizing the risk of collisions. In cases where multiple documents must be updated in a single transaction, the client offers a session feature. A session allows multiple documents to be modified without committing changes until a dedicated commit method is called.

## 8. Metadata, Versioning

### Considerations

This chapter explores the ability to add metadata to documents and provide a versioning feature in document databases.

### MongoDb

In MongoDB, metadata can be added to a document by including additional fields within the document itself. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not have a separate metadata table or mechanism to store metadata. Instead, you can simply add more fields to your document to store the necessary metadata.

Similarly, document versioning can be implemented in MongoDB by adding version-related fields to your document and creating a separate collection to store the previous versions of a document.

## 9. Quality of client SDK for dotnet

### Considerations

This chapter explores the ease of use and resiliency of the .NET client driver for MongoDB in C#.

### MongoDb

The MongoDB client driver is lightweight and easy to use. However, there can be some issues when specifying a connection string, particularly when using account authentication. The connection string must be a URL encoded string value, and some special characters in the password may break the connection string.

The client driver performs atomic operations, but retries are only possible if the deployed server is an enterprise version.

The client driver uses a connection pool to communicate with the server, allowing for efficient reuse of connections and improved performance.

When connected to a replica set, the client driver has the ability to select and communicate with healthy servers based on a server selection criteria. This helps to ensure high availability and robustness in the face of network failures or other issues.

## 10. Installation, Setup, and Other Infrastructure Notices

### Considerations

This chapter explores the ease of installing a document database as an infrastructure specialist.

### MongoDb

The database server comes with a docker image which can pe spinned in to a container. Initial administrator credentials can be specific through environment variables and the data can also be stored in a dedicated docker volume.

MongoDB Compass is available as a CRUD explorer of MongoDB databases. 

## 11. Other

### Schemaless and constraintless nature of document databases

Unlike SQL databases, document databases do not have mechanisms in place to prevent administrators from mistakenly modifying documents, which can result in the loss of valuable data. Therefore, it is recommended that documents be accessed mostly through dedicated applications rather than a general CRUD application like MongoDB Compass. Administrators should be cautious when updating data manually. Writing a dedicated application may be more time-consuming, but it is a safer approach to modify data as updating documents directly can be unsafe.
