# :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Reverse Proxy

## Usage

A reverse proxy is a server or software component that acts as an intermediary between client devices and one or more backend servers. 

The reverse proxy sits between clients and servers, accepting incoming requests and routing them based on various criteria such as domain name, URL path, or request type.

This allows multiple servers to appear as a single server to clients.

It enables several benefits:
* load balancing
* caching
* SSL termination
* discovery
* affinity
* rate-limiting

## YARP

YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) is an open-source project developed by Microsoft. It is a reverse proxy server designed to provide advanced capabilities and flexibility for handling HTTP and HTTP/2 traffic.

YARP offers a modular and extensible architecture, allowing developers to customize and extend its functionality to meet specific requirements. It is built on top of the .NET platform and is primarily aimed at providing a high-performance, scalable, and customizable solution for reverse proxy scenarios.

## Setting up YARP

The following code snippet provides an example of how to setup YARP reverse proxy to read the configuration
from the `appsettings.json` file.
```
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddReverseProxy()
    .LoadFromConfig(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"));

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRouting();
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapReverseProxy();
});

app.Run();

```

## Example Configuration

In the configuration below we can see the following things:
* all requests that have the path prefix `/api/v1/` will be routed to `https://localhost:8001`;
* all requests that have the path prefix `/api/v2/` will be routed to `https://localhost:8002`;
* all other requests will be routed to `https://localhost:9001`;
```

          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

The `Routes` section define URL routes and to which clusters they will be proxied to.

The `Cluster` section is used to define the endpoints of the backend servers 
to which the requests will be proxied to. 

A cluster can contain multiple `Destinations` or instances. This should be used exclusivelly with 
backend services that are stateless.
