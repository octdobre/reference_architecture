# Reference Architecture for Web Applications

## Project goal

An example solution that uses best practice patterns for developing web applications.


### Application Patterns

* Endpoint Load Balancing(calculate endpoint weight and create or delete nodes, and balance endpoints on nodes)
* [Vertical Slice Architecture](/Studies/1.vertical_slice_architecture.md)
* Event Sourcing
* Caching
* Partition gated clearance(sepparate data in partitions, isolate and update individual partitions, and enable
updated nodes to work with the newly updated partitions of data)

### Application Testing Patterns

* In Memory Testing Of Applications
* Performance testing
* Penetration testing

### Infrastructure Patterns

* [Cryptography for the web : OpenSSL](/Studies/3.cryptography_for_web.md)
* [Document Databases](/Studies/2.document_databases.md)
* [Public Key Infrastructure : OpenSSL](/Studies/4.public_key_infrastructure.md)
* [Reverse Proxy](/Studies/5.reverse_proxy.md)
* Reverse proxy real-time configuration
* Containers
* Serverless
